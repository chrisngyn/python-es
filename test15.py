# Machine Learning in Python
# What is ML? Using a computer to generate knowledge from data, like image recognition.
# Modules used: scipy (installs scipy and numpy too), scikit-learn, and ipython
# python3 -m pip install scipy
# python3 -m pip install scikit-learn
# python3 -m pip install ipython
# python3 -m pip install "ipython[notebook]" - for something called jupyter notebook lol
# since that didn't work, try: brew install jupyter
# I guess we're abandoning this IDE
# to open Jupyter Notebook, in terminal type "jupyter notebook".
